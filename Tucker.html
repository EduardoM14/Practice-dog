    <p>Tucker is 15-years young and despite being a little deaf and a little blind, he still lives life to the fullest. He lost his eye fighting a dog twice his size. Some would say he was attacked but this old man was part of the problem. He was trying to prove he was the toughest in the yard and tried to take doen the biggest one in the dog park.</p>
